#Downtime
An application for logging and viewing downtime at MAX IV.

Starts an Express server for logging downtime


Stuff to sort out:
- Data not auto filled in, when an old event is opened for editing.
- When sorting datatable by date the date is treated like a string and sorted alphabetically.
- Datatable layout is not particularly pretty. Needs to be made nicer.
