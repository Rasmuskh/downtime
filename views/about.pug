        p This app is for logging downtime events to a database as well as for viewing and collecting statistics on those events.
        b The Downtime index:
        p This page allows you to view a table of all downtime events as well as a pie chart and some statistics. The events, which are shown in the table and plotted in the chart, can be filtered by machine or by event type via the buttons on the top left. They can also be filtered by range for the parameters date, time (of day), duration.
        p The following statistics are calculated for R1, R3 and SPF, for the date interval chosen by the user: Planned delivery (hours), total downtime (hours), uptime (%), Mean Time To Repair (hours), Mean Time To Failure (hours), Mean Time Between Fauilures (hours). Note that the statistics only can be filtered by date.
        p The database can also be filtered by keyword via the searchbar above the table. The input in the searchbar is not treated as a single string, but as a number of strings seperated by whitespace. This means you for example can search "BI 2018-11 dump alarm 311", if you want events in November 2018 related to beamline instabilities for which the the terms dump, alarm and 311 appear somewhere the description.
        b Detailed view:
        p Each event can be opened in a detailed mode with description, from where they can be edited or deleted.
        b Submit:
        p New events are logged via this page.
        b Event codes: 
        p  Events are labelled with the following codes:
